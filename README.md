CRUD Operations in PHP

# What is CRUD?

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. CRUD operations are basic data manipulation for the database. Most applications and projects perform some kind of CRUD functionality. Once you learn about these CRUD operations, you can use them for many projects. For example, if you learn how to create a student table with multiple columns, you can use a similar approach to create an employee table or customer table.
